# Think Piece

I wrote this while following Steve Kinney's Frontend Masters "Firebase with React" course.

Technologies used: React, Firebase (Firestore), Javascript, HTML, SASS.

I have set up a CI/CD pipeline between Github and Cloudflare Pages.  
Open <https://think-piece.pages.dev/> to see this project in production.

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```
## Usage
```sh
npm start
```
This runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
