# Think Piece

I wrote this while following Steve Kinney's Frontend Masters "Firebase with React" course.

A Single Page Application developed with React, Firebase (Firestore), JavaScript, HTML, SASS.

I have connected this repo to Cloudflare Pages.  
Open <https://think-piece.pages.dev/> to see the project in production.

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```
## Usage
```sh
npm start
```
This runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
